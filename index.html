            <p>Day one was all about settling in and getting myself used to the new surroundings. I was tasked with creating three icons. An exercise in throwing myself back into the arms of Illustrator. I had gotten used to working with on Sketch that it was a little daunting in the beginning.</p>
            
            <p>The Icons were for different sections of the company Food Coasts' website. Network and Experiences, News and Events and Certified Member. With all design tasks, I got straight to researching. The company's original Logo is Circular with solid icons, so I took to Tumblr, Pinterest, and Dribbble in search of inspiration. I found a few icons I liked that were circular and had clean line art illustrations.</p>
            <img class="blogpost-img" src=img/research-1.jpg>
            <p>Based on my research above I designed three different sets of icons. I followed the original logos colour scheme, use of text and mix of solid and line shapes. <br/> My first set of design were more illustrative, while the final designs were more literal and in keeping with the Food Coast logo.</p>
            
            <img class="blogpost-img" src=img/food-coast-ideas.jpg>

            <p>I decided to take the more literal designs and take them a little further.
            I am happy with the iconic designs however I feel the silhouette designs fit better with the feel of the company.</p>
